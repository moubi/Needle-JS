 1) Ajax class needs to be able to make more than one request with single instance;
 x 2) Make all classes inherit from NEEDLE.Object. That way they may use its methods directly:
 	NEEDLE.inheritanceMediator(Ajax, Needle);
 	function Ajax() { }
 x 5) Create script tag and copy/append it for each request, instead of creating it over and over again;
