Needle JS - a Class like Object oriented javascript framework.

Needle JS is an Object oriented javascript framework, realizing the notion of classes. Its goal is to separate logic and complexity into different files (classes), which then can be requested dynamically and extended if needed.

Needle JS exposes two global variables - NEEDLE and N (second one is exposed if window.N isn't occupied).
A core file is present containing all features needed to request, extend and implement the rest of the classes.

Classes in Needle JS are constructor functions, having:
	1) private methods;
	2) public methods;
	3) public properties;
	4) private properties;
	5) constants;
	6) static methods;
	7) static properties;
	8) constructors;
	
Structure:
    - Framework contains several files.
    - Each file has the same name as the name of the class inside.
    - Each class can be requested by NEEDLE.require() or N.require() method.
    - Classes then load in an order they have been requested.
    - All classes can be extended.
    - All base classes inherit from NEEDLE.Object class.
    - Custom user classes can extend one or more base classes.

Needle JS currently covers these browsers:
    - IE 7+
    - Opera 9.5+
    - Chrome
    - Safari 3+
    - Firefox 3 (not fully tested)

How to use Needle JS:
1) Include Needle.js file into you HTML (just before the closing BODY tag):
<script id="needle" type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/Needle.js"><\script>

2) Request some base classes:
NEEDLE.require("DOM.js");
NEEDLE.require("Ajax.js");

3) Request your own classes dependent on previously requested:
NEEDLE.require("/path/to/MyClass.js");


Note:
Developers with different syntax preferences can still use NeedleJS classes, extend them, etc, though I personally encourage you to follow the classical syntax as it is more clear and visually appealing. Programming languages like PHP and Java are closer to NeedleJS as a class structure, that why you will be privileged if these languages are into your backpack.
NeedleJS is capable to achieve what other libraries like JQuery, MooTools, YUI, etc can. What makes it different is the way it encourages you to code.
